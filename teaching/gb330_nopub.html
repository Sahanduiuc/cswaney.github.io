                  <h2 class="section-heading">Description</h2>
                  <p>This course provides an introduction to business finance.  It emphasizes the financing and investment decisions of financial managers. Topics include the time value of money, asset valuation, risk analysis, financial statement analysis, and capital budgeting. Prerequisites: ACCY  202; ECON 202, ECON 203, and ECON 230 or BUS 230.</p>

                  <h2 class="section-heading">Learning Objectives</h2>
                  <p>The aim of the course is to provide an overview of the basic concepts and principles of financial management. Students will develop a toolbox of skills that they can use to understand the decision-making process of financial managers. We will emphasize both the mathematical tools of financial decision making as well as the concepts necessary to apply those tools. Some specific outcomes include:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Understand the goals of financial management within a corporation.</li>
                    <li>Demonstrate the use of financial ratios to analyze firm performance.</li>
                    <li>Comprehend and practice basic valuation methods for stocks and bonds.</li>
                    <li>Make sense of relevant concepts and measures of risk in financial settings.</li>
                    <li>Define and be able to calculate the weighted average cost of capital.</li>
                    <li>Discover how to estimate and evaluate cash flows for a proposed project.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h2 class="section-heading">Materials</h2>
                  <p>Lecture notes, in-class activities, and practice problems will be available on this website. In addition, every student will need to purchase</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Texas Instruments BAII-Plus financial calculator</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>In addition, students may decide to purchase the following optional textbook:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><i>M: Finance, 3rd ed.</i> ISBN: 978-1259328732</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h2 class="section-heading">Lectures</h2>
                  <p>Lectures, and the associated slides, are the primary resource in this course. As such, I ask that you be respectful of your fellow students by not talking during lectures. If you have a question, please ask me directly. The use of latptops, tablets and smart phones is prohibited during lectures: students that fail to comply with this policy will be asked to leave. My recommendation is that students print out the lecture slides before class, and take notes or fill in additional details during class.</p>

                  <h2 class="section-heading">Activities (20%)</h2>
                  <p>Up to half of our class time will be spent working in groups on in-class activities that are designed to help you learn by doing. Attending class—and coming prepared to class—is therefore essential. Taken seriously, these activities will help you prepare for exams and make real-world financial decisions. The activities often involve collecting and analyzing financial data, and you should therefore bring a laptop or tablet to class, if possible. There are a few additional and important policies regarding the assignments:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Group members must attend class to receive credit.</li>
                    <li>Write the names of any missing group members on each assignment. </li>
                    <li>Activities are due at the end of class unless stated otherwise.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>With the exception of the capstone assignment, I will grade assignments on a check/check-plus/check-minus/ grading scale, which means that on each assignment you can receive a grade of A, B, or C points (or F, if you do not attend class). The best way to receive check-plus grades is to confirm your work with me during class, or during office hours (if we are unable to finish during class).</p>

                  <h2 class="section-heading">Exams (80%)</h2>
                  <p>There will be one midterm exam (40% of your overall grade) and a final exam (40% of your overall grade). The midterm exam will take place at your regular class time and location. The date and location of the final exam will be announced later in the semester. I will provide a formula sheet for both exams, and I plan to hold review sessions before both exams. If you know that you will be absent the day of an exam due to a university sanctioned event, or if you require special test accomodations, please inform me in person at least ten days before the exam date.</p>

                  <h2 class="section-heading">Grades</h2>
                  <p>Final grades will be determined by the standard criteria:<p>
                    <ul>
                      <li> > 90% - A</li>
                      <li> > 80% - B</li>
                      <li> > 70% - C</li>
                      <li> > 60% - D</li>
                      <li> < 60% - F</li>
                    </ul>
                  <p>I reserve the right to <i>reduce</i> the threshold for any grade level. Historically, the typical distribution of grades in my class is approximately 5-10% A's, 25-30% B's, 50-60% C's, and 5-10% D's and F's.</p>

                  <h2 class="section-heading">Tips & Advice</h2>
                  <p>Do the following, and you will not have trouble passing the class.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Learn the lingo. Students often struggle because they do not understand <i>what</i> questions are asking.</li>
                    <li>Do the practice problems. Focus on understanding the logic of problems and the process of solving them. What are the necessary steps? <i>Why</i> are they the necessary steps?</li>
                    <li>In-class group activities provide a good opportunities to ask and answer questions: use this time wisely.</li>
                    <li>Do not try to memorize your way through the course.</li>
                    <li>Come to class!</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h2 class="section-heading">General Policies (<a href="../teaching/syllabus_gb_330.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>)</h2>
                  <p>The link above contains general university policies regarding academic integrity, students with disabilities, sexual harassment and discrimination. In addition, I will enforce the following exam rules:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Students must take exams with their assigned section.</li>
                    <li>No make-up exams, except with a valid and documented excuse.</li>
                    <li>A valid student ID is required to take exams. If you do not present your student ID, you may not receive credit on the exam.</li>
                    <li>Students must arrive within the first fifteen minutes of the exam. Students arriving after the first fifteen minutes will not be allowed to sit for the exam.</li>
                    <li>Partially completed exams will be graded as attempted exams. Leaving the exam room without submitting your exam is considered academic dishonesty.</li>
                    <li>Only one financial calculator is allowed during the exams.</li>
                    <li>Calculator covers must be removed and put away during exams.</li>
                    <li>Electronic devices (other than a calculator) are prohibited during exams.</li>
                    <li>Hats are prohibited during exams.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <br>
